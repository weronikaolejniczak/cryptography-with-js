/**
 * Division with remainder algorithm
 *
 * Input: two binary sequences representing non-negative integers a, b
 *  a = (ak − 1, …, a0)2,
 *  b = (bl − 1, …, b0)2
 * of length k and l respectively, ai, bi ∈ {0, 1}
 * where a = ∑(k − 1)(i = 0) ai2i, a = ∑(l − 1)(i = 0) bi2i
 *
 * Output: two bit sequences q and r satisfying a = q ⋅ b + r and 0 ≤ r < b.
 *
 * WARNING: zero is represented by an empty sequence
