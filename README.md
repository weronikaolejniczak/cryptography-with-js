# Cryptography in JavaScript

## Overview

This module is being developed as a part of **Cryptography with elements of algebra** course. It includes implementation of basic and advanced algorithms, including cryptographic algorithms.

### Module 1
Module 1 includes basic algorithms:
* [addBinary]('./src/module-1/basic/addBinary.js'): school addition algorithm,
* [divideBinary]('./src/module-1/basic/divideBinary.js'): school multiplication algorithm,
* [multiplyBinary]('./src/module-1/basic/multiplyBinary.js'): division with remainder algorithm,

and advanced algorithms:

* [findInverse]('./src/module-1/advanced/findInverse.js'): finding an inverse modulo n,
* [fastPower]('./src/module-1/advanced/fastPower.js'): fast power algorithm,
* [isSquare]('./src/module-1/advanced/isSquare.js'): algorithm which checks whether an element is a square modulo p,
* [squarePrime]('./src/module-1/advanced/squarePrime.js'): algorithm which finds a square root of a square modulo p,
* [fermat]('./src/module-1/advanced/fermat.js'): algorithm which checks the primality using Fermat's test.
